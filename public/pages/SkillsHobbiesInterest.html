		Swimming and coding are two skills that I have had the good fortune to learn over time.<sup>1</sup> I enjoy both
		activities and find that they complement each other in interesting ways.<sup>2</sup> Swimming requires
		discipline,
		focus, and technique, all of which are necessary for coding.<sup>3</sup> I learned to be patient with myself and
		to stay
		committed to my goals while swimming, which has helped me persevere when faced with coding
		challenges.<sup>4</sup>
		Coding, on the other hand, has taught me how to think logically and approach problems systematically, skills
		that have also helped my swimming technique.<sup>5</sup> Swimming and coding can also be social activities, and
		I
		enjoy
		being a part of swim teams and coding groups where I can collaborate with others and learn from their
		knowledge.<sup>6</sup> Finally, I see my swimming and coding abilities as complementary parts of my overall
		personal
		development, and I hope to continue improving in both areas in the coming years.<sup>7</sup>

	<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
	<p>
		In my spare time, I enjoy eating and watching movies.<sup>1</sup> While they may not appear to be traditional
		hobbies, they
		bring me a lot of joy and relaxation.<sup>2</sup> I often spend time researching restaurants and planning meals
		with friends<a href="../images/7.gif" alt="Arnieno in Food Store" target="_blank"><img id="floatRight"
				src="../images/7.gif" style="width: auto; height: 200px;"></a>
		and family because I enjoy trying new foods and exploring different cuisines.<sup>3</sup> I enjoy cooking and
		experimenting
		with new flavors, as well as the social aspect of sharing a meal with others.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, I find that
		watching is
		an excellent way to unwind after a long day.<sup>5</sup> I enjoy the escape that watching provides, whether it's
		binge-watching a new TV show or catching up on movies.<sup>6</sup> I enjoy losing myself in a story and becoming
		immersed in
		different worlds and characters.<sup>7</sup> While some may consider eating and watching to be passive
		activities, I
		consider them to be essential components of self-care and personal enjoyment.<sup>8</sup> I am able to recharge
		and find
		balance in my life by engaging in these hobbies.<sup>9</sup>

		INTEREST
	</h2>
	<p>
		Sports and reading are two of my main hobbies that I enjoy doing in my spare time.<sup>1</sup> As someone who
		enjoys staying<a href="../images/8.gif" alt="Arnieno Swimming" target="_blank"><img id="floatLeft"
				src="../images/8.gif" style="width: auto; height: 300px;"></a>
		active, I find sports to be an extremely rewarding experience.<sup>2</sup> I enjoy the rush of endorphins that
		comes with
		physical activity, whether it's basketball, soccer, or running.<sup>3</sup> Sports also teach me important
		lessons about
		teamwork, discipline, and perseverance that I can apply to other aspects of my life.<sup>4</sup> When I'm not
		participating
		in sports, I enjoy reading.<sup>5</sup> Reading allows me to discover new worlds and ideas, as well as gain a
		better
		understanding of the world around me.<sup>6</sup> I enjoy reading both fiction and nonfiction, and I believe it
		helps me
		think more critically and creatively.<sup>7</sup> Reading also gives me a much-needed break from the stresses of
		everyday
		life, allowing me to relax and recharge.<sup>8</sup> Finally, I see sports and reading as complementary aspects
		of my life
		that provide me with both physical and mental stimulation, allowing me to be a well-rounded and fulfilled
		individual.<sup>9</sup>
