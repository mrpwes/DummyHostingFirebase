        Swimming and coding are two skills that I have had the good fortune to learn over time.<sup>1</sup> I enjoy both
        activities and find that they complement each other in interesting ways.<sup>2</sup> Swimming requires
        discipline,
        focus, and technique, all of which are necessary for coding.<sup>3</sup> I learned to be patient with myself and
        to stay
        committed to my goals while swimming, which has helped me persevere when faced with coding
        challenges.<sup>4</sup>
        Coding, on the other hand, has taught me how to think logically and approach problems systematically, skills
        that have also helped my swimming technique.<sup>5</sup> Swimming and coding can also be social activities, and
        I
        enjoy
        being a part of swim teams and coding groups where I can collaborate with others and learn from their
        knowledge.<sup>6</sup> Finally, I see my swimming and coding abilities as complementary parts of my overall
        personal
        development, and I hope to continue improving in both areas in the coming years.<sup>7</sup>
